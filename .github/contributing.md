# Contributing to frontend-developer-tests

If you're reading this, it seems likely you're interested in contributing to 
our frontend developer new-hire tests. Thanks a lot! Your changes will help 
ensure our team attracts the sharpest people. Below are some guidelines to 
help you get started along with some expectations and tips to make the process 
easier.

Bug reports and pull requests (PRs) are welcome.

Before coding any new features or substantial changes, please 
[open a feature request](https://github.com/stackpath/frontend-developer-tests/issues/new) 
to discuss the proposed changes and benefits provided to the project.

PRs comprised of whitespace fixes, code formatting changes, or other purely 
cosmetic changes are unlikely to be merged.

## Bugs

Before opening an issue, ensure the bug hasn't 
[already been reported](https://github.com/stackpath/frontend-developer-tests/issues). 
If not, [open a new bug report](https://github.com/stackpath/frontend-developer-tests/issues/new) 
with details demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

PRs are welcome if you've written a patch for a bug.

## Pull request guidelines

Please ensure the following when submitting a pull request against the project.

* A single commit should implement a single logical change.
* Code should match the surrounding style conventions. Use your editor's 
  [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) features to help.
* There should be no commented out code or unneeded files.
* Documentation should be updated or extended for behavior changes or feature 
  additions.
* The commit message should be meaningful. We encourage use of the 
  [50/72 rule](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) 
  in your commit message.

For example, here is a meaningful commit message:
```
Fix a console warning in the countries test
```

To contrast, here is an example of of a poor commit message. Note that it says 
literally what changed, but provides no context to readers.
```
Fix warnings
```
