# Frontend Engineering Problem

## API:

```
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100
```

## Objective

- Render a list of Countries sorted by the number of Users in each country
- Clicking a country should expand the list of users in that country sorted by the date registered most recent first
- Each user should show the Name, Gender, City, State, and Date Registered
- Only one country's users should be visible at once
- There should be a dropdown that filters the Users by Gender (Male, Female, All)

## Notes

- Attention should be on functionality and less on aesthetics, we have provided some base styles in src/App.css
- Candidates should not use any third party libraries
- We expect this to take around 3 hours.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The answer is in App.tsx.
